\section{Classic Mechanics}
\subsection{Formulations}
we call the description of a given theory in a particular mathematical arena a formulation of the theory.

\textbf{Lagrangian}
$$
L=T-V
$$
where $T$ denotes the kinetic energy and $V$ the potential energy.

\textbf{Euler-Lagrange equation}
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}-\frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right)=0
$$

\textbf{Hamiltonian}
$$
H=p \dot{q}-L
$$
where $p$ denotes the momentum, $\dot{q}$ the velocity and $L,$ as before,
the Lagrangian. 

\textbf{Hamiltonian's equation}
$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{d p}{d t}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}} \\ {\frac{d q}{d t}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}}\end{array}
$$

\subsection{Basic quantities}
\textbf{Momentum} is the velocity of an object times its mass
$$
\vec{p}(t) \equiv m \dot{\vec{q}}(t)
$$
$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{d p}{d t}=F} \\ {\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} d p=\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} F d t} \\ {\Delta p=F \Delta t}\end{array}
$$
\textbf{In words, this means that the momentum of an object tells
us how long it takes a given force $F$ to stop it. Formulated
differently, we need a much bigger force to stop it quickly.}

\textbf{Angular momentum} is defined as the cross product of the position vector and the momentum vector
$$
\vec{L}(t)=\vec{q}(t) \times \vec{p}(t)=m \vec{q}(t) \times \dot{q}(t)
$$
While (linear) momentum tells us how hard it
is to stop an object using a specific force, angular momentum tells us how hard it is to stop it spinning.

\textbf{Momentum and angular momentum are conserved.}

\subsection{Configuration Space}
In a physical space, we use one function $f(x)$ to describe each object in the system separately. In configuration space, we use a vector of functions $\mathbf{r}=[f(x),g(x),h(x)...]$ to describe the system as a whole. \textbf{Using the idea of gluing the
spaces together, we always only need one vector which lives in an an $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ -dimensional space. If the objects are allowed to move freely in three dimensions, our vector $\vec{r}$ lives in $\mathbb{R}^{3 N}$ since we are gluing $ N$ times $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ together.}

In configuration space, we can imagine the whole system as just one point that moves through this higher-dimensional space. Each point in configuration space corresponds to one specific configuration the system can be in.

To summarize: while individual objects move in the three dimensional physical space, the time evolution of a system as a whole takes place in a higher-dimensional configuration space. A single trajectory in configuration space describes the evolution of a system as a whole.

\subsection{Phase Space}
\textbf{Configuration space only keeps track of the locations of the various objects.} But in addition to a vector that keeps track of the locations, we need a vector that keeps track of the momenta.

This motivates the construction of the  \textbf{phase space} which works completely analogously to how we constructed configuration space. However, this time we also act as if \textbf{the momenta live in a different space and then glue the momentum spaces to our location spaces}. As a result, we can describe the complete state (not just the configuration) of our system with a single vector.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Classical mechanics in physical space is what we call the Newtonian formulation.
    \item Classical mechanics in configuration space is what we call the Lagrangian formulation.
    \item Classical mechanics in phase space is what we call the Hamiltonian formulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lagrangian Mechanics}
\begin{quote}
    Any system evolves in such a way that the action required is minimal.
\end{quote}
A path in configuration space between two fixed points $X$ and $Y$ corresponds to one specific possibility for how our system evolves between two fixed configurations. \textbf{We denote the action by $S[q(t)]$ for path the path $q(t)$ from $X$ to $Y$.} And it is calculated as:
$$
\operatorname{action}[q(t)]=S[q(t)]=\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} d t L=\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} d t(T-V)
$$
\subsubsection{Action and Lagrangian}
\textbf{Question: why we integrate over $L$ to get the action?}

\textbf{Answer:}

Kinetic energy is a measure for how much is going on in our system.

Potential energy is a measure for how much could happen, but isnâ€™t.

The Lagrangian is therefore a direct measure for the "liveliness" within a system at a specific moment in time. A high kinetic energy implies a large Lagrangian and that our system is extremely lively. A high potential energy implies a small Lagrangian and a less lively system.

\redp{The action $S[q(t)]$ is not a function but a functional.}

\textbf{A function eats a number $x$ and spits out a number $f(x)$. Specifically, the action functional $S[q(t)]$ yields a number for each path $q(t) .$ We call this number the action of the path.}

\redp{The Lagrangian is a function of the location $q$ and the velocity $\frac{d q}{d t}:$ ' $L=L(q, \dot{q}) .$ This means that the Lagrangian does not depend on the
acceleration $\frac{d^{2} q}{d t^{2}}$ or even higher derivatives.}

\subsubsection{Variational Calculus}
For an ordinary function $f(x),$ we can find the minimum by
calculating the zeroes of its derivative:
$$
\frac{d f(x)}{d x} \stackrel{!}{=} 0
$$

\redp{A minimum is characterized by its neighborhood. If all neighboring points lie higher, the point in question is a minimum.}

\textbf{Let's use this idea to once more find the minimum of the function $f(x)=3 x^{2}+x$.}

We now pick one specific location $x=a$ and start investigating its neighborhood $a \rightarrow a+\epsilon,$ where $\epsilon$ is an infinitesimally small (positive or negative) number. In general, we call $\epsilon$ \textbf{a variation.}

Putting this into the function yields
$$
\begin{aligned} f(a+\epsilon) &=3(a+\epsilon)^{2}+(a+\epsilon) \\ &=3\left(a^{2}+2 a \epsilon+\epsilon^{2}\right)+a+\epsilon \end{aligned}
$$

If the location $a$ is a minimum, we can't get lower by going in any direction $\epsilon .$ Mathematically, this implies: 

\redp{All terms first order in $\epsilon$ must vanish.} Otherwise, for a negative $\epsilon$ the function value $f(a+\epsilon)$ would be smaller than $f(a)$ and therefore, $a$ wouldn't be a minimum.

If we collect all terms linear in $\epsilon$ and demand that they vanish,
$$
\begin{array}{l}{3 \cdot 2 a \epsilon+\epsilon \stackrel{!}{=} 0} \\ {\therefore \quad 6 a+1 \stackrel{!}{=} 0}\end{array}
$$
we find
$$
a=\frac{-1}{6}
$$
The variational method of finding minima can also be applied to functionals like the action $S[q(t)],$ not just functions. Take note that for functionals, our goal isn't to find a location like $a$ which is the minimum of a function but instead, to find a function $q(t)$ which is the minimum of a function.
